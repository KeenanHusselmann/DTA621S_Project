## Numpy Supermarket Data AnalysisÂ¶

## Problem Statement
## The Numpy supermarket chain, operating in Windhoek and across Namibia, is facing challenges in making data-driven decisions to improve business performance. Despite having vast amounts of customer transaction data, this data is underutilized. This limits the supermarket's ability to:
* Improve service delivery,
* Optimize product offerings, and
* Enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
## By leveraging data analytics techniques such as data cleaning, preprocessing, predictive modeling, and ongoing evaluation, the supermarket aims to unlock insights from customer spending behavior to drive better decision-## making and improve overall business performance.
